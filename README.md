# 👋 Hi, I’m Marcel

I’m a DevOps / Software Engineer who enjoys building **systems that work in the real world**, not just in diagrams. 
I work across infrastructure, backend engineering, and automation and I care a lot about making things reliable, understandable and not painful to operate.

Most of my experience is around cloud platforms, Kubernetes and CI/CD, but I’m just as interested in **how software is built, shipped and maintained** as I am in the infrastructure underneath it.



## 🧠 How I like to work

- Build for production, not demos
- Prefer boring, predictable systems
- Care about reliability, security and cost from day one
- Think a lot about developer experience and failure modes
- Opinionated when it helps, pragmatic when it matters

I like understanding _why_ things break - and how to design systems that fail in controlled, boring ways.



## 🛠️ What you’ll find here

This GitHub is a mix of:

- Cloud & infrastructure projects (IaC, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
- Platform and backend-focused experiments
- Reliability, observability and security-related setups
- Small tools and ideas I’ve built to scratch (un)real problems

Most repos are built with a “would I trust this in production?” mindset.



## 🧩 Side interests

Outside of day-to-day engineering, I’m interested in:

- Computer security & privacy
- Distributed systems
- The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and hacker culture
- Understanding systems, technical or otherwise, at scale

These interests tend to leak into how I think about engineering and risk.
